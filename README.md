## General Description

LMIC_NMEA Code is a written ESP-IDF, where it is an integration of LoRaWAN and NMEA-Parser together to perform as LoraWAN Tester. This code will read the geographical location data thorugh Lora data tranceiver and will display the data of Longitude and Latitude in the TTN (The Thing Network) gateway server.

# _Sample project_

(See the README.md file in the upper level 'examples' directory for more information about examples.)

This is the simplest buildable example. The example is used by command `idf.py create-project`
that copies the project to user specified path and set it's name. For more information follow the [docs page](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/api-guides/build-system.html#start-a-new-project)



## How to use example
We encourage the users to use the example as a template for the new projects.
A recommended way is to follow the instructions on a [docs page](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/api-guides/build-system.html#start-a-new-project).

## Example folder contents

The project **sample_project** contains one source file in C language [main.c](main/main.c). The file is located in folder [main](main).

ESP-IDF projects are built using CMake. The project build configuration is contained in `CMakeLists.txt`
files that provide set of directives and instructions describing the project's source files and targets
(executable, library, or both). 

Below is short explanation of remaining files in the project folder.

```
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── main
│   ├── CMakeLists.txt
│   └── main.c
└── README.md                  This is the file you are currently reading
```
Additionally, the sample project contains Makefile and component.mk files, used for the legacy Make based build system. 
They are not used or needed when building with CMake and idf.py.

## Uplink Formatter

Dealing With LoRaWAN on **The Things Network** requires a custom Javascript Formatter.
Below is the **Uplink Formatter** that is needed to convert the code parsing from the End-Nodes.

```JavaScript
function Decoder(b, port) {

  var lat = (b[0] | b[1]<<8 | b[2]<<16 | (b[2] & 0x80 ? 0xFF<<24 : 0)) / 10000;
  var lon = (b[3] | b[4]<<8 | b[5]<<16 | (b[5] & 0x80 ? 0xFF<<24 : 0)) / 10000;
  var alt = (b[6] | b[7]<<8 | (b[7] & 0x80 ? 0xFF<<16 : 0)) / 100;
  var hdop = b[8] / 100;

  return {
    
      latitude: lat,
      longitude: lon,
      // altitude: alt,
      // hdop: hdop
    
  };
}
```
